# Final_Project
## Group 3

## Data
- Using hurricane data in the Atlantic Ocean from 1851-2014 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noaa/hurricane-database.

- Based on recent hurricane news, as a group we thought it would be interesting to see different aspects of hurricane intesnsity.

## Aspect 1: Analysis of intensity: Using available data, is there a change in intensity since 1851?
Machine Learning: Mulitple linear regression
Focus on the following columns: Status, Latitude, Longitude, Maximum Wind, Minimum pressure

ETL
- Remove all columns not listed above
- Break out date (M,D,Y)
- Change Event and Status to numbers
- Review records
- No nulls/missing data
- import to local database

Scatterplot/Plane of best fit

## Aspect 2: Analysis of intensity based on location.  Visualizing which areas located by the Atlantic Ocean are more at risk for Hurricanes
Tableau: We will visualize the paths of each storm along with each date.  The data used in this graph will cover data from 2010-2015.  This will show the areas that are at a higher risk of being hit by Hurricanes.  This will also show where in the Atlantic ocean each storm originated from and which stoms made landfall.
